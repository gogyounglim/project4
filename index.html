                <br><br><br><h1>About Taylor Guitars</h1>
                <br><br><p>Taylor Guitars was founded in 1974 by Bob Taylor and Kurt Listug, 
                    and has grown into the leading global builder of premium acoustic guitars.
                     Renowned for blending modern, innovative manufacturing techniques
                      with a master craftsman's attention to detail, Taylor acoustic guitars are 
                      widely considered among the best-sounding and easiest to play in the world.
                       The company is a pioneer in the use of computer mills, 
                       lasers and other high-tech tools and proprietary machinery, 
                       and today, Bob Taylor is widely recognized throughout the musical
                        instrument industry as the visionary acoustic guitar manufacturer.</p><br>
                
                <p>Today, Taylor employs over 1,200 people and produces hundreds of guitars per day 
                    exclusively in two factory complexes in the U.S and Mexico: El Cajon, California,
                     and in Tecate, Baja California, Mexico. (Taylor does not manufacture any guitars 
                     in Asia.) The company maintains an active dealer network, with Taylor guitars sold
                      through hundreds of retail locations in North America and with international 
                      distribution to 60 countries,
                     including a distribution warehouse and factory service center in the Netherlands.</p>
                
                <br><p>Every guitar player needs a great acoustic guitar – or several – in their
                     collection. Finding the right acoustic guitar for you can be 
                     a daunting process even for the most seasoned player. If you
                      are new to shopping for guitars, then it is even more critical 
                      that you learn all you can before you make your first purchase.
                       If your first acoustic guitar is not the appropriate choice for 
                       you, then it can dramatically reduce the enjoyment you will get 
                       out of your instrument. If you are a new guitar player, the wrong 
                       guitar can be downright discouraging. You want a guitar that fits
                        you, is effortless to play, and has the rich, beautiful tone you 
                        love to make it the instrument you dream of playing hour after 
                        hour.</p>
                    <br><p>Please note: Out of caution and due to increasing public health concerns,
                         effective immediately, Taylor Guitars has temporarily suspended all public and
